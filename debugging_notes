notes: 

15 of 93%, could align with (0,0,0) where tuple is (X, X*, Z)
7 of 10%, could align with the (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) pairs
why do I have 58 left over?

i think it's in the non queried portion


feb 7:
potential issue: Q is generated twice, once with and without samplequeried <- data |> filter(Q == 1)
tried a new implementation of the same thing, runs but is off even when starting close to it

sarah's and mine match in the unqueried piece, the issue is in the queried piece
hers converges appropriately
