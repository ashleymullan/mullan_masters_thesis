## Healthy Eating ‚û°Ô∏è Healthy Living {.center}
  - A healthy diet increases the likelihood of good overall
health and **decreases risk of preventable illness** (World Health Organization, 2019). 
  - Maintaining a healthy diet requires **consistent access to healthy food**, which may be hindered by geography or income.
  - Review studies found **high prevalence of diabetes** in food-insecure households (Gucciardi et al., 2014).

## Choosing a Food Access Measure {.center}
1. Count the number of healthy food retailers in a given radius (i.e., **density**)
2. Compute the distance to the nearest healthy food retailer (i.e., **proximity**)
3. Create an **indicator** of low food access that evaluates to $1$ if zero healthy food retailers exist within a given distance

::: {.notes}
we compute from the centroid of a census tract
don't forget to mention the USDA as the source of our indicator and how they make multiple based on diff dists and rural
up next: all of these require distance computations

## Distance Computations {.scrollable }
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

  - The **Haversine distance** is a trigonometric function of latitude and longitude.
  - It ignores physical obstacles, so it **underestimates** the true distance between two points and is considered **error-prone**.
  - The Haversine distance in the image is **impassable**, as it crosses a pond.

## Distance Computations

::: {.column width="70%"}

  - The **route-based distance** works around obstacles.
  - It is **more accurate** than the Haversine distance but is **computationally expensive**.

## Guiding Questions {.center}

1. Can we use a function of distance to healthy food retailers to **quantify food access** in Forsyth County, North Carolina, even if this function is **subject to misclassification**?

2. Can we estimate the relationship between **low food access** and **diabetes** prevalence?

::: {.notes}
up next: two phase design to tackle these questions
:::

## Two Phase Design {.scrollable .smaller}
  - Having some correct route-based distances is better than none.
  - Error-prone Haversine distances are available for all $N$ neighborhoods, and we can use them to create our indicator of low food access $X^*$ that is subject to misclassification.
  - In addition to $X^*$, we **query** route-based distances $X$ for $n$ neighborhoods, where $n < N$.

existing methods coming up
:::

## Existing Methods
  - Functions of **sensitivity** and **specificity**
can be used to estimate prevalence of an imperfectly classified outcome (Speybroeck et al., 2013).

  - Binary variables may be created from continuous ones with non-differential error, but the new variables may still have **differential error** (Flegal et al., 1991). 
  
  - Validation data can be used to build a model for $X$ and use it for **multiple imputation** (Cole et al., 2006).

::: {.notes}
non-differential is independent of outcome
advantage of MLE over imputation is that it's computationally simpler and has easier standard errors to grab
our partially queried dataset is a validation study
:::

## Existing Methods

  - **Naive regression models**, where error-prone $X^‚àó$ is used
in the place of $X$ will have regression coefficients that are biased by a function of the sensitivity and specificity (Shaw et al., 2020). 

  - We follow Tang et al., and others by considering a maximum likelihood estimator (**MLE**) that incorporates **both queried and unqueried** observations.
  
## Simulation Roadmap {.center}
We compare the **<span style="color:#E5B80B;"> gold standard approach </span>** to the following approaches:

1. Naive Analysis (replace $X$ with $X^*$)
2. Complete Case Analysis (only use rows that have $X$)

The coefficient we are looking to estimate has true value $\beta_1 = 2$ throughout the simulation study.

## Naive Analysis Simulations

![](varying_error_results.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}

## Complete Case Simulations
![](varying_missingness_results.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}

## Simulation Summary {.center}

  - The naive approach is **biased** when compared to the gold standard.
  - The complete-case approach is **unbiased** but has a higher variance than the gold standard and is **inefficient**.
  - We want to our estimator be **unbiased** and **efficient**.


## Notation {.center}

  - $X$ is an error-free binary explanatory variable
  - $X^*$ is an error-prone version of $X$
  - $\boldsymbol{Z}$ is an error-free covariate vector
  - $Y$ is an outcome (diabetes prevalence in a neighborhood)
  
  We are interested in finding the coefficient vector $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ from the Poisson model of $Y \mid X, \boldsymbol Z$.
  
## Building the Log-Likelihood {.center}

The log-likelihood function is constructed based on the available data, and we build up from the ideal to reality through the following three cases.

  1. Accurate and Not Missing ü§©
  2. Not Accurate but Not Missing ü§®
  3. Not Accurate and Missing ü§î

## Simple Case (ü§©)
  - All observations take the form $(X,Y,\boldsymbol{Z})$.
  - Our Poisson model of interest comes from breaking up the joint probability of an observation.
  
  $$P(Y,X,\boldsymbol{Z}) = P_\boldsymbol{\beta}(Y \mid X, \boldsymbol{Z})P(X \mid \boldsymbol{Z})P(Z)$$
  
  - We end up maximizing: $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N}\log\{P_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(Y_i \mid X_i, \boldsymbol{Z}_i)\}$
  
  
## The Useless Case (ü§®)
  - All observations take the form $(X, X^*, Y, \boldsymbol{Z})$.
  - Again, break up the joint probability and simplify.
  
  $$P_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(Y,X,\boldsymbol{Z}, X^*) \propto P_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(Y \mid X, \boldsymbol{Z})P(X \mid X^*, \boldsymbol{Z}).$$
  
  - We don't care about this case, as it is **not necessary** to use $X^*$ if we have fully observed $X$, and we end up maximizing the same function as the ideal case.

## Our Case (ü§î) {.center}
  - We have employed **two-phase design** to ensure that $n$ observations take the form $(X, X^*, Y, \boldsymbol{Z})$ and $N-n$ observations take the form $(X^*, Y, \boldsymbol{Z})$.
  - Using **surrogacy**, the conditional independence of $X^*$ and $Y$ given $X$, we can set up the outcome model and the error model, parameterized by $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\eta}$ respectively.
  
## Our Case (ü§î)

We first handle the $n$ queried observations.

  $P(Y,X,\boldsymbol{Z}, X^*)$
  
  $\phantom{PPPPP} = P_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(Y \mid X, X^*, \boldsymbol{Z})P_{\boldsymbol{\eta}}(X \mid X^*, \boldsymbol{Z})P(X^*, \boldsymbol{Z})$
  $\phantom{PPPPP} = P_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(Y \mid X, \boldsymbol{Z})P_{\boldsymbol{\eta}}(X \mid X^*, \boldsymbol{Z})P(X^*, \boldsymbol{Z})$
  
We now handle the other $N-n$ observations by **marginalizing** over $X$.
  
  $$P(Y,X^*,\boldsymbol{Z}) = \sum\limits_{x=0}^{1}P(Y,X=x,\boldsymbol{Z}, X^*)$$
  
## Our Final Log Likelihood {.smaller .center}

  - In the full log likelihood, **each observation's contribution is additive**, so we can now use all $N$ observations along with $Q_i$, an indicator for the query status of observation $i$.

  - We are ready to maximize the equation below using numerical methods in $R$ to solve for $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ and better understand the relationship of interest. 

$$\ell(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\eta}) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^N Q_i\log P_{\boldsymbol{\beta},\boldsymbol{\eta}}(X,X^*,Y, \boldsymbol{Z}) + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^N (1 - Q_i)\log P_{\boldsymbol{\beta},\boldsymbol{\eta}}(Y, X^*, \boldsymbol{Z}).$$
  

  
## Next Steps {.center}

  1. Implement this MLE in an R package.
  2. Conduct simulations to assess its bias and efficiency.
  3. Apply this estimator to our real data.
